My personal Raspberry Pi dashboard.

**Yes I know I should not put styling inline, sorry**

## Todo

Drawer is always there, but if not needed button is hidden

Modules can use the bar for extra info/nav

Clickup module has spaces/folders in sidebar, and in breadcrumb

- lists > list > tasks > task > timer

you can go from task > timer, or from clickup dashboard to timer, select task on timer screen

when redirect task auto selected
